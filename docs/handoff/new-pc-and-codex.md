# New PC and Codex handoff

Updated: 2026-07-19

This is the durable handoff for moving Dredmorpedia to another computer or opening it in a new Codex task with no chat history. Canonical product and architecture documents remain authoritative; this guide summarizes the state needed to resume safely.

## Resume checklist for Codex

1. Read `AGENTS.md` completely and follow it.
2. Read `PROJECT.md`, the dated repository audit, modernization proposal, roadmap, data/asset policy, and ADR 0001.
3. Run `git status -sb`, `git log --oneline --decorate -5`, and `git remote -v` before changing anything.
4. Run `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit-legacy.ps1` to confirm the preserved baseline.
5. Ask the owner for the local game-installation path only if the next task needs read-only integration measurements. Do not assume the path from the previous computer still applies, and never commit it.

A useful first prompt on the new machine is:

> Read `AGENTS.md` and `docs/handoff/new-pc-and-codex.md` completely, inspect Git status, and continue from the documented next milestone. Treat the game installation as read-only and do not push or publish anything without my request.

## Repository identity and state

- Canonical GitHub repository: `https://github.com/dredmorpedia/dredmorpedia.git`.
- Working branch: `master`.
- The last GitHub-tracked commit at handoff preparation was `68ee565`.
- `ed71652` relocated all 1,450 tracked legacy files under `legacy/` as exact renames with no content changes.
- `4fa3d8a` added the modernization analysis, project/agent guidance, roadmap, ADR process, data policy, and repeatable audit.
- The transfer-handoff commit containing this document follows those commits. Use `git log` rather than relying on this document for its own hash.
- No modern application or package workspace has been scaffolded yet.
- The preserved application is served with `legacy/` as its document root and must remain runnable until parity is demonstrated.
- At handoff preparation, the working tree contained no ignored or untracked local payloads. Recheck this rather than assuming it remains true.

The local commits do not need to be pushed before transfer. A Git bundle includes them. Pushing to GitHub is a separate owner-approved action.

## Confirmed decisions from the owner conversation

| Area | Confirmed direction |
| --- | --- |
| Rebuild | Build the replacement from scratch; use legacy behavior and data rules as evidence, not as the target architecture. |
| Coverage | Complete useful legacy functional/content coverage before the project becomes primarily an improvement effort. Vertical slices are delivery steps, not a reduction of the parity target. |
| Official sources | Support the base game and all three official expansions first. Keep mod support architecturally possible, but broad mod support is the lowest initial priority. |
| Platform | Proceed toward a pnpm/strict TypeScript workspace, deterministic Node data pipeline, framework-independent domain layer, and Next.js App Router/React web app. ADR 0001 remains Proposed until its spike and policy gates pass. |
| Rendering/hosting | Start with static export and validate GitHub Pages as the leading free-hosting candidate without hard-coupling the project to it. |
| Styling/components | Use Tailwind CSS plus project-owned design tokens and selectively copied shadcn/ui components backed by Base UI. Create a modern interface rather than copying the legacy design, while retaining enough game-inspired character that approved official icons/images do not look out of place. Add only components required by a product slice and treat their source as maintained web-layer code. |
| Themes | Support light, dark, and system modes from the first real UI foundation. |
| Language | Ship in English initially. Do not add localized routes, translation catalogs, a language selector, or manually translated game content without a maintained source and plan. Keep canonical game text separate from interface copy so localization can be added later without changing record identity. |
| First improvements | After parity, prioritize richer filters (including crafting-skill level where relevant), explicit “used to craft” and “used to encrust” relationships, then consider tagging, favorites, and custom lists. |
| Persistence | Do not choose local storage, accounts, or a database prematurely. Favorites/lists need a later persistence and portability decision. |
| Community | No community or social features are planned for the initial project. |
| Live tracking | Potentially valuable, but it is a separate later research track. It must prove what game/save/runtime state is observable and remain read-only, safe, and privacy-preserving. |
| Collaboration | The owner intends to build the project with Codex over time. Keep decisions, commands, risks, and progress in the repository. For unresolved decisions, use focused Q&A and explain concerns/tradeoffs plainly. |

## Non-negotiable data boundary

The game installation is read-only. Inspection and hashing are allowed; editing, patching, formatting, renaming, moving, deleting, or writing inside it are not. Approved inputs may be copied into a separate gitignored workspace when a task requires it.

Do not commit or publish official databases/assets, local paths, generated derivatives with unresolved rights, credentials, or additional bundled-mod derivatives. The exact supported installed build and the legal/publication boundary remain unresolved. The inherited code also lacks a root license, and bundled mods/assets do not have one obvious shared license.

The full policy is in `docs/data-and-assets-policy.md` and overrides any historical mutation instructions preserved under `legacy/`.

## Known baseline

The repeatable legacy audit should report:

- 1,450 files in `legacy/`;
- 19 first-party JavaScript files and 6,170 lines;
- 83 XML files: 82 valid and one known invalid file at `legacy/windmagic/mod/spellDB.xml`;
- 28 missing official database files in a clean checkout, which is expected because proprietary data is excluded.

The invalid Wind Magic XML and missing official databases are baseline evidence, not cleanup tasks. Strict audit switches intentionally fail for them.

## Immediate next milestone

Continue with the ADR 0001 architecture/data-pipeline spike. Keep it deliberately narrow:

1. Verify current supported Node, pnpm, Next.js, React, Tailwind, and test-tool versions from primary documentation before pinning them.
2. Scaffold only the workspace needed to prove package boundaries and canonical commands.
3. Establish project-owned Tailwind tokens and add only the shadcn/ui + Base UI components required by the spike interaction.
4. Add independently authored synthetic fixtures covering representative entities, an override collision, invalid XML, a dangling reference, and a missing asset.
5. Put XML access behind a project-owned adapter; preserve provenance and emit source-located diagnostics.
6. Prove deterministic output by producing byte-identical artifacts and checksums from two identical imports.
7. Generate one static item page and one bounded client-side search/filter interaction.
8. Validate a GitHub Pages-compatible static export, including repository subpath/base-path behavior.
9. If the owner supplies an installed game path, measure the full official base-plus-DLC dataset read-only and write all artifacts outside the installation. Do not commit restricted output.
10. Record parser, artifact-format, and any revised platform decision as ADR updates before broad scaffolding.

ADR 0001 should remain Proposed until its acceptance checklist is satisfied. Do not start broad parity implementation or expand the design system beyond the spike’s needs merely because the spike renders one page.

## Open decisions and blockers

- Exact canonical game build/version.
- Rights and policy for publishing normalized official data and art.
- License/provenance treatment for inherited code, historical mods, and assets.
- Acceptance statement for the first parity slice.
- Priority among the recorded post-parity quality-of-life candidates.
- Technical feasibility of live progress tracking, deliberately deferred.

Do not resolve these by assumption. Ask the owner when a choice would materially change the implementation or publication boundary.

## Safe transfer package

Run from the clean repository on the old PC:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/create-transfer-package.ps1
```

The script creates `dredmorpedia-transfer-<timestamp>.zip` beside the repository. It contains:

- `dredmorpedia.bundle` — all committed Git refs and history, including local unpushed commits;
- `RESTORE.md` — a copy of this guide;
- `MANIFEST.txt` — source branch/commit, remote, creation time, and checksums.

Because the package is built from committed Git objects, it excludes ignored/untracked official data, generated output, credentials, editor state, and machine-specific files. The script refuses to package a dirty working tree, refuses to write inside the repository, does not overwrite an existing archive, verifies the bundle, and validates the ZIP contents.

### Restore on the new PC

1. Copy the ZIP through Google Drive and verify its SHA-256 against the value printed by the packaging script or recorded separately.
2. Extract the ZIP to a temporary folder.
3. Clone the bundled history:

```powershell
git clone .\dredmorpedia.bundle dredmorpedia
Set-Location dredmorpedia
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/dredmorpedia/dredmorpedia.git
git status -sb
git log --oneline --decorate -5
```

4. Configure the preferred repository-local Git author identity on the new computer; local Git configuration is intentionally not transferred by the bundle.
5. Open the restored folder in Codex and use the resume prompt above.
6. Provide the new machine's game-installation path only when a read-only integration task needs it.

The Codex chat transcript, local game installation, ignored data, local Git configuration, credentials, editor extensions/settings, dependency caches, and generated artifacts are not transferred. This document is the intentional substitute for relying on the old chat transcript.

## Why not zip the working folder directly?

A whole-folder ZIP can include ignored proprietary/generated files because `.gitignore` does not affect archive tools. Some Windows ZIP workflows also omit hidden files such as `.git`, which would lose local history and unpushed commits. A raw ZIP is acceptable only after independently verifying its complete contents and exclusions; the bundle-based package is the canonical transfer method for this repository.
